        <h2>Soils Information</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Black Soils</h3>
            <p><strong>Parent Material:</strong> The parent material for most of the black soil is volcanic rocks formed in the Deccan Plateau (Deccan and the Rajmahal trap). In Tamil Nadu, gneisses and schists form the parent material. The former are sufficiently deep, while the latter are generally shallow. These soils are typical of dry and hot regions of the Peninsula with high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics of Black Soils</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A typical black soil is highly argillaceous with a large clay content, 62% or more.</li>
                <li>Black soils of uplands are generally low in fertility, while those in valleys are very fertile.</li>
                <li>The soil retains moisture well, swelling significantly when wet. It becomes sticky in the rainy season and cracks deeply in summer due to moisture evaporation.</li>
                <li>The lower layers of the soil can still retain moisture, and the cracks allow for oxygenation, resulting in extraordinary fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Colour of Black Soils</h3>
            <p>The black color is due to the presence of titaniferous magnetite or iron and black constituents of the parent rock. In Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, the black color comes from crystalline schists and basic gneisses. Various tints of black color such as deep black, medium black, shallow black, and a mixture of red and black may be found.</p>

            <h3>Chemical Composition of Black Soils</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>10% alumina</li>
                <li>9-10% iron oxide</li>
                <li>6-8% lime and magnesium carbonates</li>
                <li>Potash is variable (less than 0.5%)</li>
                <li>Phosphates, nitrogen, and humus are low</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Distribution of Black Soils</h3>
            <p>Spread over 46 lakh sq km (16.6% of the total area) across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, parts of Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu.</p>

            <h3>Crops in Black Soils</h3>
            <p>Black soils are best suited for cotton crops, hence they are also called regur and black cotton soils. Other major crops include wheat, jowar, linseed, Virginia tobacco, castor, sunflower, and millets. Rice and sugarcane are also important where irrigation facilities are available. A wide variety of vegetables and fruits are successfully grown on black soils. This soil has been used for growing various crops for centuries with minimal use of fertilizers and manures, showing little evidence of exhaustion.</p>
